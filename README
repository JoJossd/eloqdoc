BUILDING

- Pre-requisite for 'mongo', the MongoDB interactive shell:

  The shell requires the library ../v8/libv8.  There is no v8 binary distro, so
  we recommend you install and build V8 as follows:

    $ cd ..
    $ svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8
    $ cd v8
    $ scons libv8.a

  To compile the unit tests, you need to install the unit test framework from:
     http://unittest.red-bean.com/

   $ cd ..
   $ svn co http://svn.red-bean.com/unittest/trunk/ unittest
   $ cd unittest
   $ make
   $ sudo make install

- Then use scons to build.  

  If you want to build everything (mongod, mongo, tools, etc):

     $ scons .

  If you only want to build the database:

     $ scons

RUNNING

Run ./db and command line options will display.

COMPILER VERSIONS

Mongo has been tested with GCC 4.1.2 and Visual Studio 2008.  Older versions
of GCC may not be happy.

NOTES

Mongo uses the 10gen appserver and the Java Virtual Machine to execute 
user program code in the database.  This feature is optional -- if you would 
like to run the database without these installed, run with the --nojni 
option.  With --nojni specified, the db.eval() and $where features are no 
longer available.

Mongo uses memory mapped files.  If built as a 32 bit executable, you will 
not be able to work with large (multi-gigabyte) databases.  However, 32 bit 
builds should work fine with small development databases.
